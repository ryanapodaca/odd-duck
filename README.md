This is a program that is utilzed to determine which product the Odd Duck Company should create next in their product line.  The document displays three products, and prompts the user to select one.  This process iterates 25 times.  Afterwards, the totals are collected and a graph is generated to show how the products compare to each other in terms of how often they have been selected vs. how often they have been displayed.
